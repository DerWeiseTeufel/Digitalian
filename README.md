This is Digitalian is an application where people can draw and get probability distribution of custom-CNN trained on MNIST. The project was intended to be an additional exercise for Machine Learning class in Saratov State University. 
Following my design, the app was intended to show benefits, as well as limitations and imperfections of CNNs. When the drawing doesn't match any of digits pattern, the user can see, that NN still gives confident predictions.
To draw simply press on 28x28 grid. To get the probability distribution press on "Get distribution", to clear the board press:"Clear all".
The project was done using PyTorch, matplotlib, pandas, numpy, tkinter libraries.
